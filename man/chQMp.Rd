\title{Calculating the monthly chained quadratic mean of order r price index}
\usage{
chQMp(data, start, end, r = 2, interval = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The user's data frame with information about sold products. It must contain columns: \code{time} (as Date in format: year-month-day,e.g. '2020-12-01'), \code{prices} (as positive numeric), \code{quantities}  (as positive numeric) and \code{prodID} (as numeric, factor or character).}

\item{start}{The base period (as character) limited to the year and month, e.g. "2020-03".}

\item{end}{The research period (as character) limited to the year and month, e.g. "2020-04".}

\item{r}{The real and non-zero parameter.}

\item{interval}{A logical value indicating whether the function is to compare the research period defined by \code{end} to the base period defined by \code{start} (then \code{interval} is set to FALSE) or all fixed base indices are to be calculated. In this latter case, all months from the time interval \code{<start,end>} are considered and \code{start} defines the base period (\code{interval} is set to TRUE).}
}
\value{
The function returns a value (or vector of values) of the monthly chained quadratic mean of order r price index - see CPI Manual (2004), Section 17.40, formula 17.35 (page 321).
}
\description{
This function returns a value (or vector of values) of the monthly chained quadratic mean of order r price index.
