\title{Saving the machine learning model on the disk}
\usage{
save_model(model = list(), dir = "ML_model")
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A list of 8 elements which identify the previously built machine learning model (the list is obtained via the \code{model_classification} function).}

\item{dir}{The name of the directory where the selected model should be saved. The directory with all necessary files will be created in the working directory.}
}
\value{
This function saves a list of ML model elements on the disk, i.e. the resulting 8 files are written into the new directory specified by \code{dir}. The list should be obtained previously using the \code{model_classification} function. After saving the model, it can be loaded at any time by using the \code{load_model} function.
}
\description{
This function saves a list of machine learning model elements on the disk, i.e. the resulting 8 files are written.
