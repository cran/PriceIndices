\title{Extending the multilateral Geary-Khamis price index by using the FBMW method.}
\usage{
gk_fbmw(data, start, end)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The user's data frame with information about sold products. It must contain columns: \code{time} (as Date in format: year-month-day,e.g. '2020-12-01'), \code{prices} (as positive numeric), \code{quantities}  (as positive numeric) and \code{prodID} (as numeric or character).}

\item{start}{The base period (as character) limited to the year and month, e.g. "2019-12".}

\item{end}{The research period (as character) limited to the year and month, e.g. "2020-04".}
}
\value{
This function returns a value of the multilateral Geary-Khamis price index extended by using the FBMW (Fixed Base Moving Window) method. It measures the price dynamics between periods \code{end} and \code{start} and it uses a 13-month time window with a fixed base month taken as \code{year(end)-1}. If the distance between \code{end} and \code{start} exceeds 13 months, then internal Decembers play a role of chain-linking months. The month of the \code{start} parameter must be December. To get information about both price index values and corresponding dates, please see functions: \code{\link{price_index}}, \code{\link{price_indices}} or \code{\link{final_index}}. The function does not take into account aggregating over outlets or product subgroups (to consider these types of aggregating, please use the \code{\link{final_index}} or the \code{\link{final_index2}} function).
